# A-Very-Very-Bad-Fork-Bomb

This is bad... but kid of fun. 

Normally fork bombs create files that create files leading into a unstopabble multiplation leading into computer crashing.

This on the other hand is safer to use. This program only creates files when the program is running.

Even though this should be pretty safe, I am not responsible for any problems caused by this program. Why even would you use this ? This is bad.

Why files write MUDA ? I mean, i didnt know what to write and i love JoJo.
